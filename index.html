            <p>I have a few other mild goals with regards to growth and data to help me
                pitch to bigger brands, but I'm going to keep those close to the chest for
                now. I know that if I hit a certain amount of posts by spring, I'm going to
                spend some money on custom-branded images and a redesign,
                but let's see how these things go first. </p>

            <p>
                Hello there! I am making a short diversion from my lockdown series today to
                wish everyone a happy first day of fall! That’s right. Fall (or Autumn as
                it’s called in some parts of the world) is finally here, and I am looking
                forward to cooler weather and shorter days ahead. I love the in-between
                seasons of spring and autumn and fall is definitely one of my favorite
                times of the year. There’s a change in the air, the weather is just about
                right, and who can forget the festivals around the corner with all their
                lovely traditions and food!
            </p>
